Welcome!

I'm Minchul Park, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Korea University.

My research interests include econometrics and data science, with a focus on treatment effect analysis, bootstrap methods, and the application of machine learning to causal inference.

Beyond theoretical research, I am committed to developing statistical software that makes it easier for economists to implement my methods.

Please find here my CV.
