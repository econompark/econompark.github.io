Welcome!
I'm Minchul Park, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Korea University.
My research interests include econometrics and data science, with a focus on treatment effects analysis in staggered adoption settings, bootstrap methods, and the application of machine learning to causal inference.
Beyond theoretical research, I am committed to developing statistical software that makes it easier for economists to apply my methods.
