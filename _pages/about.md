Welcome!

I'm Minchul Park, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Korea University.

My research interests include econometrics, applied economics, and data science, with a focus on causal inference and labor economics.

In addition to theoretical work, I am dedicated to developing statistical software that enables applied researchers to implement my methods with ease.

Please find my CV [here](/files/CV_20250916.pdf).
