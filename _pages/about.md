Welcome!

I'm Minchul Park, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Korea University.

My research interests include econometrics and data science, with a focus on treatment effect analysis, bootstrap methods, and the application of machine learning.

In addition to theoretical work, I am dedicated to developing statistical software that enables applied researchers to implement my methods with ease.
