### Difference-in-differences for heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered and self-selected adoption

This paper proposes a new difference-in-differences estimator to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered adoption settings. To identify the average treatment effects, the proposed method introduces a selection model for treatment timing. Under this model, the counterfactual trends in the difference-in-differences parameters are identified by deriving specific forms for the averages of unobserved confounders in those trends. This identification approach permits non-parallel trends in the never-treated outcomes by allowing them to be generated by an interactive fixed effects model. Moreover, unlike most methods based on interactive fixed effects models, the proposed method does not require a large number of pre-treatment periods. The proposed method is particularly suitable for settings where treatment timing is self-selected, and its empirical relevance is illustrated by estimating the short-term effects of first childbirth timing on womenâ€™s labor market outcomes. For practical implementation, a Stata command {\tt didselect} is provided.
