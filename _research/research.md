### Difference-in-differences for heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered and self-selected adoption settings

**Summary:** This paper proposes a new difference-in-differences estimator for heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered adoption settings. To identify the average treatment effects, a selection model for treatment timing is introduced. With this model, the counterfactual trends in the difference-in-differences parameters are identified by deriving specific forms of the average unobserved confounders. This approach allows for violations of the parallel trends assumption due to unobserved confounders. Unlike most methods addressing the non-parallel trends issue, the proposed method does not require a large number of pre-treatment periods. Extensions of the proposed method are also considered, including an extension to multivalued treatments. The empirical relevance of the proposed method is illustrated by estimating the short-term effects of first childbirth timing on women’s labor market outcomes. For practical implementation, a Stata command _didselect_ is provided.

### A parametric specification test for Roy models
(with Chirok Han)

**Summary:** This paper introduces a new specification test for parametric Roy models, which assesses whether economic agents' decisions follow the original or generalized Roy model. We derive a new restriction equivalent to the original Roy model and propose a Wald test based on this restriction. Unlike existing methods, our test does not require instruments because it utilizes only parameters that can be identified without them. To facilitate the practical application of the proposed method, we provide a Stata command _roy_specification_.
